# Home automation integration for Worx Landroid robotic mowers
 
This is a small [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) library that allows integrating [Worx Landroid robotic 
mowers](https://www.worxlandroid.com/) with various home automation systems for logging/charting Landroid status such as 
battery percentage and notifications for Landroid alarms.
  
The library is assumed to work with any Landroid sporting WiFi and a RESTful API (such as WG796E and WG797E),
and has been tested with WG796E firmware version 12.1 and 12.6. Please report any breaking changes to the API.

## Common installation
(_The installation instructions make reference to .bat files. If you are not on Windows, you are assumed to know what to
do..._)

Regardless of the home automation system you are planning to use, you need to do the following:

1. Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/). Make sure you allow `npm` to be on your `PATH`.
2. Clone this Git repo - `git clone https://github.com/mjiderhamn/worx-landroid-nodejs.git`
  (First install [Git](http://git-scm.com/) if not already installed). Or by all means use the
  [GitHub Windows client](https://windows.github.com/).
3. Run `install.bat` to download dependencies.
4. Edit the cloned [`config.js`](config.js). Should be self explanatory. Although you may want to wait with this step until
  you have installed your home automation software, since you will need some details from that installation.

## Home Assistant
If you plan to use [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io), follow the installation instructions at 
[https://home-assistant.io/getting-started/](https://home-assistant.io/getting-started/).
 
To start sending Landroid information to Home Assistant run `landroid2home-assistant.bat`.

For tips setting up push notifications, see [here](home-assistant.md).

## Domoticz

If you plan to use [Domoticz home automation system](http://domoticz.com/), follow these additional steps: 

1. Set up some [MQTT broker/service](https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/servers), such as [Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org/)
  1. Note that on Windows you may need to install OpenSSL, see http://git.eclipse.org/c/mosquitto/org.eclipse.mosquitto.git/tree/readme-windows.txt
     linking to http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
2. Install [Domoticz](http://domoticz.com/) on some supported hardware (PC, Raspberry Pi, ...). 
3. Start sending Landroid data to Domoticz by running `landroid2domoticz.bat` 
4. Use your browser and navigate to _Utility_ in the Domoticz UI.

## InfluxDB 2.x

You can have metrics collected from the mower(s) reported to [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/)
Time Series Database (TSDB).

Edit the `InfluxDB2` section of [`config.js`](config.js) and insert your InfluxDB URL, organization, bucket and 
[authentication token](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/security/tokens/).

Metrics are reported to the `landroid` measurement.
